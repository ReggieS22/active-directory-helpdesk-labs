# active-directory-helpdesk-labs 

This repository showcases a collection of simulated Active Directory (AD) labs that demonstrate common Tier 1 IT Helpdesk tasks. All labs were completed in a Windows Server environment hosted on AWS EC2, simulating a real-world enterprise setup.

These labs were designed to build hands-on experience with Active Directory user and group management, one of the core responsibilities of helpdesk and IT support roles.
